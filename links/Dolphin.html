 		<h2><br>Dolphin<br></h2>
 		<p class="para">
			Dolphins are part of the toothed whales. Generally, they are among the smaller whales. Most live in salt 
			water oceans, but some live in rivers – there are oceanic dolphins and river dolphins. Dolphins are from 
			1.5 metres (4.9 ft) to 4 metres (13 ft) long, but the largest dolphin, the killer whale (or orca), can be 
			up to 8 metres (26 ft) long.<br><br>
			All dolphins live in groups called "pods". They are social animals at all stages of their life. They have 
			some remarkable behaviours. A speeding group of dolphins is a sight to see. They "porpoise" in and out of 
			the water at high speed. The function of this is not known for sure. It may be the fastest movement they 
			are capable of. What they eat, almost exclusively, is fish. When they chase fish, the fish go into a "bait 
			ball" to self-protect. In turn, the dolphins attack in a group and eat as many fish as they can.<br><br>

			<h4><br>The Dolphin<br></h4>
			The name 'dolphin' comes from the Ancient Greek δελφίς (delphis) meaning "with a womb", because it was 
			first thought to be a fish with a womb. It is now known to be a mammal, and quite an intelligent mammal. 
			Dolphins breathe air. A dolphin's nose is on top of its head so the dolphin can easily breathe on the 
			surface of the water. The skin of a dolphin has no scales. It is soft and smooth. However, it is very 
			firm, due to how much muscle they have. Dolphins use echolocation to find their food.<br><br>
			The skin of a bottlenose dolphin is gray, smooth, and rubbery. They are always social. They can help each 
			other fight off predators. Dolphins have fought off sharks in this way. They can kill large sharks by 
			ramming them over and over again with their snouts and heads. They look after the young, when the mothers 
			need to leave their calves to hunt for food. The young need to breathe more often than the adults, and 
			the food may be in deeper waters.<br><br>
			Oceanic dolphins are marine animals living in the sea. They live in all of the oceans.Three of the four 
			species of river dolphins live in fresh water rivers. The La Plata dolphin lives in saltwater estuaries 
			and the ocean. Water pollution and the loss of habitat are a threat to some dolphins, especially those 
			living in rivers and estuaries.<br><br>
